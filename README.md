# Airport board Project

Information about the flight schedule (arrival, departure) for today, yesterday, tomorrow and the selected date from the calendar.
Ability to search the flight by flight number or destination/

The sky is closed and all flights are canceled from February 24, 2022 due to the war.
Therefore, it is possible to view flights for previous dates.

FYI: there is a certain feature of the API work: server can return a status 500 in response to the first request for each new searched date (should reload page), then mostly it works correct.
